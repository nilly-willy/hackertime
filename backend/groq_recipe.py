Classic Chicken Stir-Fry

Ingredients:
- Chicken:
  - 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, thinly sliced
- Vegetables:
  - 1 red bell pepper, sliced
  - 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
  - 1 medium carrot, thinly sliced
  - 1 cup broccoli florets
  - 1 cup snap peas
- Sauce:
  - 3 tbsp soy sauce (or low-sodium soy sauce)
  - 2 tbsp oyster sauce (optional)
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 1 tbsp cornstarch (to thicken)
  - 1 tbsp rice vinegar
  - 1 tbsp honey (optional, for sweetness)
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 inch fresh ginger, minced
- Optional garnish:
  - Sesame seeds
  - Green onions, chopped

Instructions:
1. In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, rice vinegar, honey (if using), garlic, and ginger.
2. Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat with a little oil. Add the sliced chicken and cook until browned, about 4-5 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside.
3. In the same pan, add a little more oil and cook the vegetables for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally until theyâ€™re tender but still crisp.
4. Return the chicken to the pan and pour in the sauce mixture. Stir well to combine, and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
5. Serve hot with rice or noodles and garnish with sesame seeds and green onions if desired.
